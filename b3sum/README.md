# Building

The standard way to install `b3sum` is:

```
cargo install b3sum
```

On Linux for example, Cargo will put the compiled binary in
`~/.cargo/bin`. You might want to add that directory to your `$PATH`, or
`rustup` might have done it for you when you installed Cargo.

If you want to install directly from this directory, you can run `cargo
install --path .`. Or you can just build with `cargo build --release`,
which puts the binary at `./target/release/b3sum`.

AVX-512 support (via C FFI, with dynamic CPU feature detection) and
multi-threading (via Rayon) are enabled by default. Note that the
underlying `blake3` crate does not enable those by default.
